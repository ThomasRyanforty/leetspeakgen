# leetspeakgen
leetspeakgen.py is a Python3 tool that reads any wordlist and generates every combination of common leetspeak substitutions (a→@, o→0, e→3, i→1, s→\$). By pre-expanding words, it lets password crackers like John the Ripper skip per-word rule mangling and directly consume a fully expanded list.
